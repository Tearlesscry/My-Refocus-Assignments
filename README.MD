Hi im Marvin Bernales. I'm a registered pharmacist by profession.
I do photography and videography in my free time.I also edit videos.
Only 2 months left until the end of the year. I just want to slowly expound my programming skills.
I wanted to be a developer because i don't see growth here in my current job.
I want to create things i want to explore and hopefully make an impact one day.
